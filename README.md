# Introduction
This is a collaborative personal project with @RileyRichards (https://github.com/RileyRichards). We wanted to make a desktop application that visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm using PyGame. 

# How to Use
Run Path-Finding.py
## Controls
- `Left Click and Drag` to draw walls
- To set endpoints:
  1. `Right Click` to set the start point
  2. `Right Click` again to set the end point
- `Enter` to run.

# To-Dos:
Finish GUI system that allows for a more flexible UX (i.e., allowing user to change start/end points once initially set, allowing user to run program repeatedly without restarting it from scratch).
